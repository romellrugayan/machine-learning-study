## Machine Learning 
Study of machine learning algorithm (some of them were based from coursera's online courses by Andrew Ng)
* Simple Linear Regression
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Polynomial Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Regression
* Logistic Regression (Softmax for multi classification)
* Linear Regression Model (Ridge / Lasso / Elastic Net)

## Machine Learning Project
* Housing - based on A.Geron's book: 'Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow
* Apartment in New York - project-based lecture from Terrence Parr and Jeremy Howard ebook
* Apartment in New York Part-2 - project-based lecture from Terrence Parr and Jeremy Howard ebook
* Titanic (EDA and Modeling) - datasets from Kaggle competition

## Cheat-Sheet in Machine Learning
* Matrices - a collection of Python codes to create arrays/matrices, shape manipulation, matrix operation, etc.
